<h3 align="center"> Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I'm <B>Sylvester</B></h3>
<hr>

A Software developer who works mostly on the front end of all things web and in consistent quest for opportunities to learn and grow!

I enjoy working in teams, pair programming and collaborating with other developers on innovative solutions. You'll mainly find me poking around open-source projects, opening issues, submitting PRs and sometimes building them myself! ðŸ”¥ðŸš€

When I'm not smashing my keyboard to make magic happen, I devote my time to developer communities and mentoring upcoming developers.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on more open source projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js and all things backend
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ReactJS, Web Performance, PWA, Testing, Open Source, Developer Communities...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love vacation.
